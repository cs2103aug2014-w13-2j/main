COMMAND NAME
		REDO	

SYNOPSIS
	REDO
		
DESCRIPTION
	Command REDO allows you to undo the previous UNDO Command and revert
	the effect of the UNDO Command.
			
	The UNDO-able Command's when entered into Dynamiz are kept in a stack in 
	memory. This allows Dynamiz to keep track of the ordering of the Command
	entered. Once an UNDO Command is issued, Dynamiz will keep another stack 
	of REDO to keep track of the ordering of the UNDO Command issued. 
	So the Command REDO will undo the most recent UNDO Command.
	
	Since, the REDO'able Command's are kept in a stack in memory, restarting 
	of the session will reset the stack. Therefore, you will not be able to
	UNDO the command once the session is closed.
	 
	If you make a mistake in REDO an UNDO Command, you can revoke an
	UNDO Command to restore the effect of the UNDO Command. 
	For details of UNDO Command, enter "help undo".
