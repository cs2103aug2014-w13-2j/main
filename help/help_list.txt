COMMAND NAME
		LIST	

SYNOPSIS
	LIST [Option arguments]... [ORDER_BY argument]
	
DESCRIPTION
	Command LIST allows listing and filtering of items in Dynamiz.
	
	[Option arguments]: Specify the applicable [Option arguments] for the 
	item being filtered against. Non-applicable [Option arguments] will be 
	not be considered in the filtering. [Option arguments] can be added
	in any order in the command.
	
	Applicable (OptionType)'s for Command LIST are:
		START_TIME, END_TIME, ON_TIME, PRIORITY
	
	[ORDER_BY argument]: (Optional) Specify the sorting order of the listed
	items. This [ORDER_BY argument] requires be specified last in the command.
	If there is no [ORDER_BY argument] specified, a default sorting order of
	[<status>, PRIORITY, END_TIME, START_TIME]
		
	Listing logically performs a Union of the items inside the database that
	match at least one of the filtering criterion. 	
	Here's how you can use the command:
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	- List all the existing items in the database:
	Command: list
	
	No [Option arguments] is given so logically, all the items in the database
	match this filtering criterion. 
	
	No [ORDER_BY argument] is specified so the default sorting order of the 
	listed items will be applied.	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- List tasks that have either a start timing of today or tomorrow:
	Command: list starttime today, tomorrow
	
	[Option arguments]: 
		START_TIME	: "today, tomorrow"
		
	All task items that have the START_TIME information stated as today or
	tomorrow will be listed. For example, if today is 2/11/2014, then all task 
	items that have the START_TIME of 2/11/2014 and 3/11/2014 will be listed.
	This will logically list Event items that match because only Event items 
	have START_TIME information.
	
	No [ORDER_BY argument] is specified so the default sorting is applied.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- List tasks that have either start timing and end timing of today:
	Command: list on today
	
	[Option arguments]:
		ON_TIME		: "today"
		
	All task items that have either the START_TIME information of today or
	the END_TIME information as today will be listed. For example, if today is 
	2/11/2014, then all task items that have START_TIME of 2/11/2014 and/or
	END_TIME of 2/11/2014 will be listed. 
	
	The ON_TIME (OptionType) allows the indication of START_TIME and END_TIME. 
	Hence, this is equivalent to the Command "list from today to today".
	
	No [ORDER_BY argument] is specified so the default sorting is applied.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- List all tasks having priority High regardless of timing and sort by 
	deadline (the earliest come first):
	Command: list priority high orderby deadline
	
	[Option arguments]:
		PRIORITY	: "urgent"
		
	[ORDER_BY argument]: END_TIME
	
	All task items that have PRIORITY HIGH will be listed. The list will be
	sorted by deadline since [ORDER_BY argument] is specified. 
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Once your LIST command is entered, a list of matching items will be output
	through the Output Screen. 
	
	In case the output list has fewer than 4 items, the listed items will be 
	listed in individual form. 
	In case the output list has no fewer than 4, the listed items will be listed as a 
	constant width formatted list. 
	In case the output list has no item. A "Empty list" message will be output.
