COMMAND NAME
		UNDO	

SYNOPSIS
	UNDO
		
DESCRIPTION
	Command UNDO allows you to undo the previous entered Command and revert
	the effect of the previous Command.
	
	The followings are the Command that are supported with UNDO Command:
		- ADD
		- DELETE
		- MARK
		- UPDATE
			
	The UNDO-able Command's when entered into Dynamiz are kept in a stack in 
	memory. This allows Dynamiz to keep track of the ordering of the Command
	entered. So the Command UNDO will undo the most recent UNDO-able Command.
	
	Since, the UNDO'able Command's are kept in a stack in memory, restarting 
	of the session will reset the stack. Therefore, you will not be able to
	UNDO the command once the session is closed.
	 
	If you make a mistake in UNDO an UNDO-able Command, you can revoke an
	REDO Command to restore the effect of the UNDO-able Command. 
	For details of REDO Command, enter "help redo".
