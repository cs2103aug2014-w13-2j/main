COMMAND NAME
		UPDATE	

SYNOPSIS
	UPDATE [parameter] [Option arguments]... 
	
DESCRIPTION
	Command UPDATE allows updating an existing item in Dynamiz. 
	
	[parameter]: The parameter can be divided into two parts. The first 
	part (required) is the ID number of the item to be updated. The second part 
	(optional) is the update in the description of the item. The description
	will be overwritten.
	
	[Option arguments]: Specify the [Option arguments] of the 
	item being updated. Non-applicable [Option arguments] will be 
	deemed as part of the description updated. [Option arguments] can be added
	in any order in the command.
	
	Applicable (OptionType)'s for Command SEARCH are:
		START_TIME, END_TIME, ON_TIME, PRIORITY
	
	Updating an existing item will modify the information of that item with 
	the new information. The command will overwrite the (OptionType) where 
	applicable. This allows the possibility of transforming task item of 
	one type to another (e.g., from a floating task to event task). 	
	Here's how you can use the command:
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	- Update the description of an item ID 12 with reserving the remaining 
	information:
	Command: update 12 A new description
	
	[parameter]: "12 A new description"
	The first part of [parameter] will specify the ID number of the item to
	be updated so item having ID number 12 will be updated with the second 
	part of [parameter]. Hence, item having ID number 12 will have a new
	description of "A new description"
	
	No [Option arguments] is given so all the other information is preserved. 
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Update item ID 13 with a new deadline 12 Nov 2014 5pm:
	Command: update 13 due 12 Nov 2014 5pm
	
	[parameter]: "13"

	[Option arguments]: 
		END_TIME	: "12 Nov 2014 5pm"
		
	The first part of [parameter] specifies "13" hence the item having ID number
	13 will be updated. The second part of [parameter] is empty, hence there will 
	be no change in the description. A new END_TIME information is given so
	the item having ID number 13 will have its END_TIME information updated, 
	regardless of what the previous value it holds. 
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Update item ID 14 with a new description, a new start timing, and a new
	priority: 
	Command: update 14 Meeting with The President at MBS from 13/11/2014 17:00
	priority low
	
	[parameter]: "14 Meeting with The President at MBS"
	
	[Option arguments]:
		START_TIME	: "13/11/2014 17:00"
		PRIORITY	: "low" 
	
	The first part of [parameter] specifies "14" hence the item having ID number
	14 will be updated. The second part of the [parameter] specifies "Meeting
	with The President at MBS", hence, the existing description will be over-
	written with this.
	
	A new PRIORITY is specified so the PRIORITY information of item ID 14 will 
	be assigned as LOW. A new START_TIME is specified as well so the START_TIME
	information of this item will be assigned as 13/11/2014 17:00.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Once your UPDATE command is entered and the item is present in the database,
	the previous information of the updated item will be given along with the 
	updated information to the Output Screen for you to double check.
	
	If you make a mistake in typing information to the item, you can revoke an
	UNDO Command to remove the item. For details of UNDO Command, enter "help 
	undo".
