COMMAND NAME
		SEARCH	

SYNOPSIS
	SEARCH [parameter] [Option arguments]... [ORDER_BY argument]
	
DESCRIPTION
	Command SEARCH allows searching for items in Dynamiz. Search can be
	conducted for (Description) and (OptionType)
	
	[parameter]: The search keywords for (Description) of the items. 
	Dynamiz will conduct a case-insensitive search, thus, the following
	search keywords are equivalent "hello", "HELLO", "HeLlO".
	
	[Option arguments]: Specify the applicable [Option arguments] for the 
	item being filtered against. Non-applicable [Option arguments] will be 
	not be considered in the filtering. [Option arguments] can be added
	in any order in the command.
	
	Applicable (OptionType)'s for Command SEARCH are:
		START_TIME, END_TIME, ON_TIME, PRIORITY
	
	[ORDER_BY argument]: (Optional) Specify the sorting order of the listed
	items. This [ORDER_BY argument] requires be specified last in the command.
	If there is no [ORDER_BY argument] specified, a default sorting order of
	[<status>, PRIORITY, END_TIME, START_TIME]
		
	Searching logically performs an Intersection of the items inside the 
	database that match all of the searching criteria. Hence, Dynamiz will 
	guarantee to return an empty search list if for one (OptionType), multiple 
	values are given. 	
	Here's how you can use the command:
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	- Search all task items that contain the keyword "anniversary":
	Command: search anniversary
	
	[parameter]: "anniversary"
	All task items that have "anniversary" as part of their description will
	be returned.
	
	No [Option arguments] is given. 
	
	No [ORDER_BY argument] is specified so the default sorting order of the 
	listed items will be applied.	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Search all task items that contain keyword "report" and due 21 Oct 2014:
	Command: search report due 21 Oct 2014
	
	[parameter]: "report"

	[Option arguments]: 
		END_TIME	: "21 Oct 2014"
		
	All task items that have "report" as part of their description and an 
	END_TIME of 21/10/2014 will be returned. Items fail to match all of 
	the criteria will not be listed.
	
	No [ORDER_BY argument] is specified so the default sorting is applied.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Search all task items that have Priority LOW and end timing of today, 
	ordered by start timing:
	Command: search priority low endtime today orderby starttime
	
	No [parameter] is specified, so logically all items in the database will
	match this criterion.
	
	[Option arguments]:
		PRIORITY		: "low"
		END_TIME		: "today"
		
	[ORDER_BY argument]:  START_TIME
		
	All task items that have both the PRIORITY of LOW and END_TIME as today 
	will be listed. For example, if today is 2/11/2014, then all task items 
	END_TIME of 2/11/2014 and PRIORITY LOW will be listed. The listed items
	will be sorted by START_TIME information.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Once your SEARCH command is entered, a list of matching items will be output
	through the Output Screen. 
	
	In case the output list has fewer than 4 items, the listed items will be 
	listed in individual form. 
	In case the output list has no fewer than 4, the listed items will be listed as a 
	constant width formatted list. 
	In case the output list has no item. A "Empty list" message will be output.
