Many a times, several tasks/events have descriptions which contain certain keywords that can also act as informal categorization. Sometimes you may have a long list of things to get done but just want to do things that belong to a certain “category”. The search command helps you filter out items that contain a certain keyword (and hence are more likely to be related to the same context). The search command is defined as:

	search <keyword>

This gives you a list of tasks/events whose descriptions contain the given keyword.
As an example, suppose the task added by the add command example is the only item in the list, the command search Programming returns the Programming Assignment task that was previously added.
