COMMAND NAME
		DELETE		

SYNOPSIS
	DELETE	[parameter] 
	
DESCRIPTION
	Command DELETE allows the deletion of existing items in Dynamiz.
	
	[parameter]: The ID of the item to be deleted.
	
	Deletion of an item is straight forward. The deleted will be removed from
	the database. The deleted item will still be kept in memory for the current 
	session in case there is an invoke of UNDO Command. However, the deleted
	item will be lost once Dynamiz is closed and there is no way to retrieve it.
		
	Here's how you use the command (as illustrated by examples):
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	- Delete an item having ID number of 31:
	Command: delete 31
	
	[parameter]: "31".
	The item having ID number of 31 will be removed from the database.
	In case, there is no item having ID number of 31. An error feedback will be 
	output to acknowledge you about the invalid ID number entered.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Once your tasks have been deleted to Dynamiz, feedback messages will be output
	onto the Output Screen for you to double check on the information of the item
	you have deleted.
	
	If you make a mistake in deleting undesirable item, you can revoke an
	UNDO Command to revert the deletion of the item. For details of UNDO Command, 
	enter "help undo".
