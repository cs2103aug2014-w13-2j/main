COMMAND NAME
		UNMARK	

SYNOPSIS
	UNMARK	[parameter] 
	
DESCRIPTION
	Command UNMARK allows marking a Completed item as Pending in Dynamiz.
	
	[parameter]: The ID of the item to be marked as Pending.
	
	Unmarking of an item is straight forward. The pending items will have their 
	statuses changed from Completed to Pending.

	Here's how you use the command (as illustrated by examples):
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	- Unmark a completed item having ID number of 31:
	Command: unmark 31
	
	[parameter]: "31".
	The item having ID number of 31 will be unmarked from Completed to Pending. 
	The item status will be changed from "Completed" to "Pending"
	In case, there is no item having ID number of 31. An error feedback will be 
	output to acknowledge you about the invalid ID number entered.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Once your tasks have been unmarked to Dynamiz, feedback messages will be output
	onto the Output Screen for you to double check on the information of the item
	you have deleted.
	
	If you make a mistake in deleting undesirable item, you can revoke an
	UNDO Command to revert the deletion of the item. For details of UNDO Command, 
	enter "help undo".
	
	Equivalently, you can invoke an UNMARK Command to achieve the same effect, 
	although, internally there is a subtle difference.
