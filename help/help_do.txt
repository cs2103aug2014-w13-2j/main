COMMAND NAME
		MARK	

SYNOPSIS
	MARK	[parameter] 
	
DESCRIPTION
	Command MARK allows marking a pending item as completed in Dynamiz.
	
	[parameter]: The ID of the item to be marked as completed.
	
	Marking of an item is straight forward. The completed items will be stored 
	in the main database for one weeks before being archived to the completed 
	database ("completed.txt"). 	

	Here's how you use the command (as illustrated by examples):
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	- Mark an item having ID number of 31 as completed:
	Command: mark 31
	
	[parameter]: "31".
	The item having ID number of 31 will be marked as completed. The item status
	will be changed from "pending" to "completed"
	In case, there is no item having ID number of 31. An error feedback will be 
	output to acknowledge you about the invalid ID number entered.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Once your tasks have been deleted to Dynamiz, feedback messages will be output
	onto the Output Screen for you to double check on the information of the item
	you have deleted.
	
	If you make a mistake in deleting undesirable item, you can revoke an
	UNDO Command to revert the deletion of the item. For details of UNDO Command, 
	enter "help undo".
	
	Equivalently, you can invoke an UNMARK Command to achieve the same effect, 
	although, internally there is a subtle difference.
